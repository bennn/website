A short guide to Redex concepts, conventions, and common mistakes.

### What is Redex useful for?

1. declaring [regular-tree]() grammars
2. defining _pattern_-based judgments and relations on _terms_
3. testing properties of the above

More generally, Redex is helpful for experimenting with a programming language
 design, and helping you decide what you might want to prove about a language.
TODO


### What is Redex **not** useful for?

Proving theorems about a grammar, judgment, or relation.


### What is a _term_?

Informally, a term is:

- a Redex "atom", or
- an object that represents a sequence of characters.

More formally, a term is the result of evaluating `(term X)`, where `X` is
 any Racket expression.

Examples:

```
$ racket
Welcome to Racket v6.10.0.3.
> (require redex/reduction-semantics)
> (term 42)
42
> (term (+ 2 2))
'(+ 2 2)
> (term ("hello" world (#false)))
'("hello" world (#f))
```

Some terms may look strange.
That's OK, because a term by itself has no meaning.
A term is just "a Redex atom".


### What is a _Redex model_?

A Redex model is a Racket program with tools for building and using terms.

The tools include TODO


### What is "Racket mode"? What is "Redex mode"?



### What is a pattern?

### What is a language?

### Metafunctions vs Judgment forms

### Mode Spec, how affects binding

### Side Conditions

### dots

### Underscores

### What Patterns Cannot Express?

### Binding Forms


### Julia's question, overlapping MF patterns and where clause
