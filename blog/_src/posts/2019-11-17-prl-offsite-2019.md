On November 11th 2019, the PRL had a private offsite meeting at the
 [More Than Words bookstore][mtw] in downtown Boston.
The goal of this post is to record what happened and how
 (for future organizers).

## Early Planning, Goals

Every Fall, the PRL holds a kickoff meeting to assign [roles](http://prl.ccs.neu.edu/contact)
 for the coming academic year.
This year, Prof. Amal Ahmed led the meeting and expressed interest in having
 a retreat at some point.
Seconds later, Amal enlisted Olek Gierczak and Ben Greenman
 to help plan a retreat.

> Ben G. was on the (unsuccessful) 2018 retreat planning committee.
> The three lessons from that year were: (1) Veterans Day is a possible date
> in the Fall, (2) there are approximately zero possible dates in the Spring
> and Summer, (3) the [Warren Conference Center](http://www.warrencenter.com)
> is Northeastern University's [franchised](https://www.northeastern.edu/events/northeastern-owned-off-campus-venues)
> off-campus venue.

The **motivation** for the retreat was to bring our growing department together
 for one day in the hope that everyone has (at least) a small interaction with
 everyone else.
These little interactions are crucial for new Ph.D. students --- both to get
 to know the group, and to become known.
They're also useful for everyone else to build a stronger community and
 to open doors for collaboration.
And yet, despite the fact that these interactions are an admittedly key benefit
 of having a lab, the last time the PRL got all together in a big way (more
 than a few hours for PL seminar or Ph.D. open house) was for the
 [Spring 2017 edition](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/7480-s17/index.html)
 of HOPL.

Our primary **goal** this year was for every Ph.D student to present research.
Time permitting, we wanted a keynote speaker, a panel discussion, and activities.
Weather permitting, we wanted to go outside during lunch.

In light of the main goal, we prefer to call the event an "offsite"
 (or "offsite meeting") rather than a "retreat" because we wanted an
 informative day rather than a relaxing one.


## Booking

venue, food, other?

We chose a venue. We tried the warren center, but it took a while to get in
contact. We tried calling, and they connected us to the event manager, I left a
message, and they never responded. Amal contacted events, who contacted the
warren center after *insert time here* they got back to us, with a pretty high
price tag, attach pdf. We tried the alumni center, but it's closed on holidays
(pick a non holiday date if you want to stay on campus). We tried Yelp, but
spaces seemed to fancy (geared towards big companies). We looked outside
Boston, not much luck. We found MoreThanWords on google, and contacted them to
rent their space, attach pdf. Met with Aida VR, liked the space, and went with
renting it.

Insurance/contract signature. After getting set up with MTW, we had to get the
contract signed and insurance sent over. We needed liability insurance through
northeastern because it's a Northeastern event. We contacted *insert name* at
legal to get insurance and signature. They heavily expedited the process, but
seemed to be frustrated doing so. The normal timeline for this would be *insert
time here*. Thankfully, MTW was good about putting a soft hold on the
contract/payment. The bookstore was closed on Veteran's Day, but that wasn't a
problem for holding the event that day.

MTW is a neat venue in its outreach; /

We booked from 9am-6pm, with 1 hour before and after for cleanup. We ran a bit
late (cleanup started at like 6:40pm), which was okay.

MTW had no whiteboard. We borrowed giant post-its and MTW had an easel, but
nobody used it anyway (except for the activity).

Catering. We booked flour for lunch catering. Easy; online form. The form
didn't have options for Veteran's Day, but we sent an email and they got back
to us in 1-2 days. Cup of coffee, local coffee shop for breakfast/beverages,
took 4 days to respond. Overall we were happy with the quality of everything.
We mostly just found places by looking at google maps and checking nearby.
Nothing besides flour seemed to have an online form, and the few emails we sent
out was hit or miss for responses, so we recommend calling. Coffee: 3 gallons
of coffee in the morning, 1 gallon of tea. Too much coffee! 2 gallons of
coffee, 1 gallon of tea is good for ~25 people. Not enough blueberry muffins!
Muffins/croissants over bagels. Cup of coffee did not provide small plates!
They provided all else. Flour didn't give us enough forks, bring own utensils
just in case! We got too many sandwiches; we got 30 sandwiches (60 halves).
Meat went quickly, so did hummus and cauliflower grilled cheese. People didn't
seem to like the potato and goat cheese as much. Maybe there is a better
caterer for veggie/vegan friendly. We picked assorted sandwiches. In the
future, specify! 2 people wished there was desert (sticky buns!). More than
words asked us who the vendors were, we named names, and that was the end of
that.

Keynote invitation: Kathi Fisler. She ended up saying no due to some plans, but
said thanks for the invite, and mentioned interest in being a keynote for
future offsites. This was fortunate because our goal was for every PhD student
to talk, and this made it much easier to do that and have breaks. Even longer
breaks, especially in the afternoon, would be good!

We needed more time for breakfast/for people to show up! We started around
9:20/25, and ended it on time. Maybe shift things a bit. 

3 15 minute talks in a row, break, and at the end of the day a panel (which ran
late) and that was the whole day. 

The panel started with asking faculty for a mistake in their career.
Discussions ran long, and we didn't have a panel moderator that helped switch
between topics and discourage people from monologuing too long, and the panel
would have been more productive had we had that. 

Analyses:

Panel maybe could have been run differently? What goal are we trying to solve
with the panel, and are there other ways to have the same kind of discussion?
